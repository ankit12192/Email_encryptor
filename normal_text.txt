This bed is harder than my boyfriend's. Unfamiliar too. And this isn't my usual hangover. Something smells funky. Ugh.

I risk turning my head to the side. The room wobbles. I blow hair out of my mouth. There's a man's ear within licking distance. Nick Bailey's ear. So much for my great plan.

It didn't start out as a plan, more a vague hope. Lisa had heard a rumour that Nick Bailey frequented a certain seedy bar, so that's where we were. The bar smelled like foul: a mixture of piss, sweat and cologne. An unlikely place to meet an A-list star, but the cocktails were cheap enough for me to take the gamble.

I was checking my phone, trying to ignore a sweater-wearing slob staring at my legs, when Lisa tottered back with our drinks and whispered: "He's actually here! Next to the slot-machine! Wearing that silly hat!"

The man she meant didn't look like the Nick Bailey I'd seen on YouTube. He was wearing a disappointingly baggy t-shirt (still tight around his arms though!) and a woolly hat that hid most of his dark-brown hair. Apart from a scruffy patch at the front. Mmm.

"Are you sure it's him?" I asked Lisa.

"Yes! He has that tattoo of a horse at the base of his neck. Or at least, it looked horsey."

Good enough. I grabbed my gin and tonic from Lisa and downed it in one. She looked at me nervously. "You're not actually going over to him, are you?"

"Isn't that why we're here?" I asked.
